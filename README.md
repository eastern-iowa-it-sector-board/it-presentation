# The IT-in-a-bag concept

A fully customizable presentation prepared to:

* Enable IT professionals to present an intro to IT talk to an audience
* Encourage more IT professionals to present (especially to younger audiences)
* Enable a starting point for the Eastern IA IT Sector Board to provide training sessions for potential presenters

# Mission

We want to make sure this concept is useful, and encourage its use. In order to achieve this we need feedback and support from our local, regional, and state IT communities. Please consider contributing changes, or submitting suggestions to the Eastern Iowa IT Sector Board.

# Goals

* We want to see this used in rural districts, as we believe they can most benefit through this type of an introductory presentation.
* We want to encourage the use of this presentation template through incentives or clearly articulated tangible benefits that can be provided to industry partners who use this concept.
